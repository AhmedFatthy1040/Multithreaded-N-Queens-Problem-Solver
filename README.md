## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
The N-Queens Solver is a Java application that aims to find solutions to the N-Queens problem. The N-Queens problem involves placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. The project utilizes a multithreaded approach for solving the problem and includes a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize the solutions.

## 2. Project Overview <a name="project-overview"></a>
- **NQueensSolver.java**: Implements the core logic for solving the N-Queens problem.
- **NQueensThread.java**: Represents a thread for solving the problem concurrently.
- **NQueensSolverGUI.java**: Provides a graphical user interface for interacting with the solver.
- **Main.java**: The main entry point for running the application.
- **pom.xml**: Maven configuration for managing dependencies.

## 3. Project Structure <a name="project-structure"></a>
The project follows a modular structure:

- com.example.nqueenssolver
  - Main.java
  - solver
    - NQueensSolver.java
    - NQueensThread.java
  - gui
    - NQueensSolverGUI.java


## 4. How to Run <a name="how-to-run"></a>
1. Ensure you have Java and Maven installed.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Multithreaded-N-Queens-Problem-Solver`
4. Build the project: `mvn clean install`

## 5. Algorithm Details <a name="algorithm-details"></a>
The algorithm uses a backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of queen placements. The time complexity is \(O(N!)\), and the space complexity is \(O(N)\).

## 6. Concurrency <a name="concurrency"></a>
The project utilizes multithreading to solve the N-Queens problem concurrently. Each thread represents a unique attempt to find a solution.

## 7. Graphical User Interface (GUI) <a name="graphical-user-interface-gui"></a>
The GUI, implemented using Java Swing, allows users to input the size of the chessboard (N) and visualize the solutions found by each thread.

## 8. Dependencies <a name="dependencies"></a>
- Java Swing for GUI components.
- Maven for project management.

## 9. Performance Considerations <a name="performance-considerations"></a>
The actual runtime may vary based on the hardware and environment. Consider adjusting thread count and other parameters for optimal performance.

## 10. Future Improvements <a name="future-improvements"></a>
- Implement additional heuristics for faster pruning of the search space.
- Enhance GUI features for better user interaction.

## 11. Contributing <a name="contributing"></a>
